The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs.

And then there's the pinto, a term so loose it could wrap around a barrel twice! It's just a fancy way of saying any old horse with some grand white patches on its coat, no matter what breed it might be. So remember, a paint horse is special, with a pedigree to match its pretty coat, while a pinto is more like a free spirit, wild and wonderful in its own right!\n",

Ah, once upon a time, it did indeed stick out like a thumb in the middle of the blue sea, but in 1928, they went and connected it to the mainland, and there ye have it, a peninsula it became. Now, it's a grand spot for a bit of recreation, with Fort Independence standing tall and proud, keeping watch over the harbor like a faithful hound. So ye see, it's not an island anymore, but a piece of land with a story as old as the hills!\n",

Ye see, there was a wee country called Ethiopia in Africa, and she was the only one down south there that didn't get herself colonized by some foreign fella. Now, way back in the 19th century, her flag had these grand colors: green, yellow, and red, ye know. Well, when Ghana came along and shook off the chains of colonial rule, she looked up to brave old Ethiopia and said, \"By me shillelagh, we'll use those colors too!\" And so, she did, as a sign of solidarity. And then, one after another, other African countries picked up on it, using those same colors to show they were all in this together, like a big, colorful family under the African sun!\n",

Ye see, homonyms are words that sound exactly the same when they're piped out, but they've got their own wee meanings, now don't they? Like when ye say \"deer\" or \"dear,\" they sound the same, but one means a little forest creature with antlers, and the other is how ye might speak to someone ye hold close to yer heart.

Now, back in the day when deep learnin' hadn't quite taken flight, SVM was the bee's knees, the cat's pajamas, if ye will. Its main gig was binary classification, but don't ye think it couldn't stretch its legs a bit and tackle multi-label classification and even a spot o' regression too!

And sure enough, it's known to pop up in the same family more than once, just like the bad weather in Dublin! Now, Ludwig Wittgenstein, he had a spot o' trouble with it himself, and it's said he felt mighty blue at times. But the real kicker is that three out of his four big brothers took their own lives, each one in their own sad way. So, if ye ask me, with so many in his family sufferin' from the dark clouds of depression or takin' their own lives, it's safe to say the green-eyed monster of melancholy was a regular visitor in the Wittgenstein household!\n",

Typically, it takes them about eighteen weeks to start layin' those golden treasures.

Ye see, it's a wee bit o' wisdom from the old folks that says, when ye're tryin' to explain somethin', keep it simple, me lad. Other things being equal, ye should favor explanations that don't need a whole herd o' fanciful notions or strange beasts. Ye want to avoid makin' up too many new ideas if ye can help it. So, it's not just about keepin' it simple, mind ye, but rather preferin' less over more, especially when ye can get away with it. Now, off ye go, and may the luck o' the Irish be with ye!\n",

In the grand world o' genetics and genomics, the phenotype is the sum o' all the observable characteristics or traits o' an organism. Ye see, it covers the physical form and structure, known as morphology, the way they develop, their biochemistry and physiology, their behavior, and even the products o' their behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, an organism's phenotype comes from two main sources, me lad: the expression o' its genetic code, which we call its genotype, and the influence o' environmental factors. Sometimes, these factors can mingle and interact, affectin' the phenotype even more. Isn't that a bit o' magic?\n",
            "\n",
            "When ye have two or more clearly different phenotypes in the same population o' a species, we say the species is polymorphic.

Ye see, it's a cap made o' soft cloth, with a little flap at the front to keep the sun out o' yer eyes. Now, why do we call it a baseball hat, ye ask? Well, because all the lads playin' aye wear these when they're out in the field, catchin' the ball and whatnot. Their team's emblem is right there on the front, proud as can be. But mark me words, many a fella'll wear one o' these hats, even if it don't have a team's badge on it. Just so long as it's got that bill up front, it's a baseball hat, by me reckoning!\n",

See, we've got our ears open and our tongues loose, tellin' tales of every colour under the sun, even them we can't see ourselves. So, if ye're askin' a poor leprechaun to describe a colour he can't see, why, he'd be happy to oblige ye with stories he's heard from his fellow critters.

            "\n",
            "Ye see, the reason why these smart folks think Tau is the bees' knees is because ye keep bumping into 2 times Pi, or 2π, all over the place in science and maths. So, they're wonderin', is Pi really the big cheese or is this Tau, twice as much as Pi, what's truly important?\n",

These plates, they're the very foundation of our fair lands and seas, and they're always on the move - sliding under one another, pushing over each other, and even rubbing shoulders like old friends at a ceilidh.

The forward pass gives us the logits -- which reflect the probability distribution over the next token -- for the next token. We can compute the loss by comparing the predicted logits to the true next token -- our target label. Note that this is effectively a classification problem! So, our loss can be captured by the cross entropy loss, and we can use PyTorch's [`nn.functional.cross_entropy`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.html) function to compute it."

Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n",

In this lab, we will use a technique called [LLM as a judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) to do exactly this. This involves using a larger LLM to score the outputs of a smaller LLM. The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."
